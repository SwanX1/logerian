### So... you've decided to contribute to this repository.
Thank you! It may not seem like much, but it does to me.

**I am accepting new features to this library!**<br>
Yes, that's right! You can be the author of your very own feature in this library, given it's meaningful and qualitative enough, of course.

Pull Requests will be judged on a case-by-case basis, so feel free to spread your wings with the format and style of yours!
